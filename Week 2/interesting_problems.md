# Some interesting problems
These may not be strictly coding, and some of them are just theoretical  
Any interested soul is welcome to try them  
By no means is it compulsory to do it tho  

## 1. Proving that mux is universal
A of muxes can be used to realise many simple gates
For example, the two circuits shown below are completely equivalent functionally

here the function implemented is (a&(~b))
In a similar way try to implement an *and* gate and a *not* gate
and now try to combine them

Since we can make a universal gate with it , it is also a universal gate.

## 2. Dual edge triggered flipflop
Try the problem named 'dual-edge triggered flip-flop' in hdlbits

## 3. Look-Up Table (LUT)

### Definition
A **Look-Up Table (LUT)** is a small memory that implements a Boolean function by storing the output for every possible input combination.

For a 2-input LUT, there are 2 inputs (A, B), so it stores 4 output values corresponding to all input combinations.

---

A 2-input LUT is defined by the following stored values:

| A | B | Output |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

---
1. Write the Boolean expression implemented by this LUT.  
2. Try drawing on paper how the circuit might look only using muxes

its sorta like binary search

This is how logic gates are actually implemented in a vast majority of FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) , they contain a bajilion of these LUTs and programmable connections which realise the whole circuit.

## 4. Grey Code to binary code and vice versa and some properties of xor
Gray coding is a mapping in which each binary number is assigned a unique binary representation such that consecutive values differ by only one bit.

You might've encountered this in K-maps where you use the ordering <00 01 11 10> where we can see that all adjacent things only differ by 1 bit.

a formula for converting binary to grey is:  
- g3 = b3  
- g2 = b3 ^ b2  
- g1 =      b2 ^ b1  
- g0 =           b1 ^ b0  
it can be generalised t0 n bits.  
Now your job is to invert these equations to convert binary to grey.

<summary>Hint</summary>
x^y is equivalent to (x+y)mod2 so commutativity , associativity hold.

Also x^x=0
